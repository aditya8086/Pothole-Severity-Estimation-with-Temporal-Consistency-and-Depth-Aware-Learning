## Pothole Severity Estimation


## Overview
This project proposes an intelligent system that detects potholes, quantifying and delineate their shape in the 2D space; and estimate the depth information in the 3D space.


## Dataset
For generating the training bounding boxes and segmentation masks, we annotate some of the  given images using Roboflow: https://roboflow.com/.
